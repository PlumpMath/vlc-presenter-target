# VLC Presenter Target

This app simplifies the process of launching a video fullscreen on a second monitor using VLC, for presentations. 

I used to use a desktop shortcut for this that was set up with the correct command-line arguments; dropping a video file onto the shortcut would launch the video on my second monitor. The advantages of this app are that it provides a bigger target to drop onto, and that it can be positioned anywhere on the screen.

There is also a small sample video embedded in the app with a "Test" menu item to launch it, so that you can verify that the app is working in a given environment.
